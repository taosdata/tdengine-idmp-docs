# Quick Start Guide

TDengine Industrial Data Management Platform (IDMP) fully leverages large AI models to automatically identify application scenarios based on ingested data and generate real-time analytics, reports, and visualization dashboards. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry and helps users discover novel dashboards and insights—greatly reducing reliance on data analysts and process engineers. As a result, it shortens the path from raw data to business insight and decision-making, improving the overall efficiency of data consumption.

In the sections that follow, we’ll guide you through three ways to experience the power of TDengine IDMP: via cloud service, Docker, and local deployment.

title: Enumeration Sets
---

To improve the readability of data, IDMP provides enumeration types. You can define certain integers as human-readable strings. As with other software, you can define multiple enumeration sets, and each set can contain multiple enumeration items. You can add, delete, modify, and query both sets and items.

What makes IDMP unique is its support for child enumeration items. An enumeration item can contain multiple other child items. Essentially, this is a way to group enumeration items, which makes filtering and searching more convenient.

Enumeration sets are managed under the "Knowledge Base" in the main menu. Since the feature is straightforward, it is not explained in further detail here.

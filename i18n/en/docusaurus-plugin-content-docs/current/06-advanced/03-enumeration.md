title: Enumeration Sets
---

You can create enumeration sets in TDengine IDMP to define certain integers as human-readable strings. You can define multiple enumeration sets, and each set can contain multiple enumeration items. You can add, delete, modify, and query both sets and items.

TDengine IDMP also supports child enumeration items. An enumeration item can contain multiple child items. This is a way to group enumeration items, which makes filtering and searching more convenient.

Enumeration sets are managed under **Libraries** in the main menu.

title: Composite Metrics
---

You can view AI-generated composite metrics under **Libraries** in the main menu. This area lists the composite metrics recommended by AI based on your collected data, business semantics, and contextual information, organized into tree hierarchies for clarity. For each composite metric, the system provides a name, description, and calculation formula. These metrics help you assess the current state of operations, determine whether the system is performing as expected, and identify potential risks or anomalies.

Because the AI-generated metrics may not be 100% accurate, TDengine IDMP allows you to download, revise, and re-upload them. You can use the download and upload buttons on the composite metrics page for this purpose. As you enrich your model with more data context and descriptive information, you can click the Regenerate button to instruct the AI to produce an updates set of composite metrics. Note that this process typically takes 5 to 10 minutes.

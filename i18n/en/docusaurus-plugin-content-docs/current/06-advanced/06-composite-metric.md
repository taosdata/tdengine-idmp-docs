title: Composite Metrics
---

Under the "Knowledge Base" section of the main menu, you'll find a menu item labeled "Composite Metrics". This area lists the composite metrics recommended by AI based on your collected data, business semantics, and contextual information, organized into tree structures for clarity. For each metric, the system provides its name, description, and calculation formula. These metrics help you assess the current state of operations, determine whether the system is performing as expected, and identify potential risks or anomalies.

Since the AI-generated metrics may not be 100% accurate, IDMP allows you to download, revise, and re-upload them. You can use the download and upload buttons on the metric list page for this purpose. As you enrich your model with more data context and descriptive information, you can click the "Regenerate" button to instruct the AI to produce a fresh set of composite metrics. Note that this process typically takes 5â€“10 minutes, so a bit of patience is required.

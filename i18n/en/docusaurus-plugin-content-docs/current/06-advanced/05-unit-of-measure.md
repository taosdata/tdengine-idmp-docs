title: Units of Measurement
---

In IoT and industrial scenarios, each data point collected may use different units of measurement (UoM). Even if unit conversion is performed during ingestion, due to variations in project timelines and other factors, inconsistencies in units may still exist in the stored data. To ensure accurate data analysis, unit conversion becomes essential.

Since modifying already stored data is not advisable, IDMP allows you to configure both a storage unit and a display unit for each attribute of an element. Whether for expression-based calculations or for simple display purposes, IDMP will automatically perform unit conversions based on the data’s stored unit.

IDMP comes with a wide range of built-in units—covering mass, length, time, temperature, volume, force, current, voltage, energy, storage, power, amount of substance, and more—but you can also extend the list as needed.

UoM management is available under the "Knowledge Base" in the main menu. Since it's straightforward, no further explanation is provided.

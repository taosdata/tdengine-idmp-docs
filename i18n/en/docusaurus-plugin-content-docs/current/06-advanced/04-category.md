To facilitate filtering and searching, you can define categories for any object in the system, including elements, attributes, panels, dashboards, and events. When creating these objects, you can assign one or more categories to them.

You can add, delete, query, and modify these categories as needed.

Categories are located under **Libraries** in the main menu.

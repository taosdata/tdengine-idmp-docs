To facilitate filtering and searching, categories can be defined for any object in the system, including elements, attributes, panels, dashboards, events, and more. When creating these objects, you can assign one or more categories to them.

You can add, delete, query, and modify these categories as needed.

Category management is located under the "Knowledge Base" in the main menu. As the feature is straightforward, it is not explained in detail here.

TDengine IDMP (Industrial Data Management Platform) is an AI-native platform for IoT and industrial data management. It organizes sensor and device-collected data using a classic tree-like hierarchical structure, establishes a data catalog, and provides contextualized and standardized data processing. Additionally, it offers real-time analytics, visualization, event management, and alerting capabilities.

This document is the TDengine IDMP User Manual, which introduces the basic concepts, core functionalities, advanced features, operations and maintenance, and best practices of IDMP. A quick-start section is also provided to help you experience the product within minutes.

If you're only looking for a general understanding of IDMP, reading the "Product Overview" chapter will suffice. For anyone in other roles, please carefully read the "Basic Concepts" chapter, as you’ll need to understand “Element”, a proprietary term used in IDMP.

If you're a business operations user and only use IDMP to view dashboards or events, please refer to the "Core Features" chapter. You can skip the sections on configuring dashboards and analysis.

If you're a data analyst or process engineer, you should thoroughly read both the "Core Features" and "Advanced Features" chapters. You’ll need to understand element templates, event templates, how to create elements and dashboards, perform real-time analysis, and configure notification rules. Reading the "Best Practices" chapter is also recommended.

If you're a system administrator, please read the "Operations Guide" carefully to understand how to install and deploy IDMP, manage system users and permissions, handle connections, configure the system, and perform backup and recovery. This chapter contains all the information you’ll need for system administration.

As a product built for the AI era, IDMP is designed with the principle that users should be able to use it without reading a manual or undergoing training. Most features are intuitive at a glance, so we haven’t gone into too much detail about how to use them—we encourage you to explore and experience them for yourself.

No matter your role or position, you are welcome to try out the “Insight Without Asking” and “Smart Data Query” features of IDMP to experience the power of AI. These features lower the barrier to entry to zero, allowing you to uncover business value from collected data—without ever needing to read the user manual.

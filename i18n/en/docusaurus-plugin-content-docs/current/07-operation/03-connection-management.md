title: Managing Connections
---

In the left-hand tree view of the Admin Console, click Connection to view the list of existing connections.

1. Click + in the connection list to create a new connection. Currently, IDMP supports two types: TDengine TSDB and AI.
1. For AI connections, all large model APIs follow a unified formatâ€”requiring a URL, token, and model name. No further explanation is needed.
1. For TDengine TSDB connections, two authentication methods are supported: username/password and token. These are also straightforward and not elaborated here.
1. Once a connection is created, you can delete or disable it. In the future, observability metrics related to connections will be provided to help troubleshoot issues.

title: Configuring TDengine IDMP
---

In the System Configuration section, you can configure the following:

1. Basic Settings: Includes settings such as privacy data collection.
1. Notification Channels: You can create multiple notification channels, including Email, Feishu, and Webhook. With Webhook support, virtually any notification method can be integrated via webhook configuration. After the first user activates or registers, their email address is automatically set up as a notification channel.
1. Notification Templates: The system sends notifications such as user invitations, password resets, etc. You can configure various templates here.
1. Email Server Configuration: Since IDMP needs to send emails in many cases (e.g., verification codes), you must configure an SMTP server. By default, the SMTP server is set to TDengine's email server after installation.

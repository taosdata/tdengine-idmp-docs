title: Configuring TDengine IDMP
---

In the System Configuration section, you can configure the following:

1. Basic Configuration: Includes settings such as data collection.
2. Notification Contact Point: You can create multiple notification channels, including email and webhooks. With webhook support, virtually any notification method can be integrated via webhook configuration. After the first user activates or registers, their email address is automatically set up as a notification channel.
3. Notification Template: The system sends notifications such as user invitations and password resets. You can configure various templates here.
4. Email Configuration: Since IDMP needs to send emails in many cases, you must configure an SMTP server. By default, the SMTP server is set to TDengine's email server.

title: Data Contextualization
---

TDengine IDMP provides data contextualization in the following ways:

1. Elements can have various static attributes, such as model numbers and serial numbers.
2. Elements can include location information.
3. Elements and attributes can be configured with a description.
4. Elements and attributes can be assigned categories, making them easier to search and tag with business labels.
5. Elements and attributes can be configured with custom properties to add personalized context.
6. Attributes can be configured with options like display units, limit values, and target values.

TDengine IDMP provides element and attribute templates to help standardize these configurations. However, TDengine IDMP cannot enforce semantic and contextual definitions. This relies on your organizationâ€™s management processes.

Data modeling is essentially a process of contextualizing data. Only when metadata is rich and accurate can valuable analysis be performed, and only then can AI truly perceive the application scenario and automatically generate analyses and dashboards.

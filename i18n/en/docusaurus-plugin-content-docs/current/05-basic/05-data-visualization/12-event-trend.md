# Event Trend Chart

The Event Trend Chart displays event-related metrics through a trend graph and highlights the time range when the event occurred. Users can add any device monitoring metrics and events to the analysis view to intuitively present the fluctuation trend of data over time.

## Data Source

You can add the `Properties`, `Events`, and `Analysis` of any element to the Event Trend Chart. When adding an `Event`, the properties related to triggering the event will be added to the Event Trend Chart, and the time range during which the event lasts will be highlighted. When adding `Analysis`, all element properties referenced in the analysis will be added to the chart; in addition, all events generated by this analysis will be added to the chart.

## Analysis Tool

### Multi-Swimlane

Multi-swimlane is enabled by default. In multi-swimlane mode, one metric occupies one swimlane.

### Align by Start Time

It is disabled by default. When enabled, it aligns multiple metric segments by their start times, truncates them, and compares the metric patterns during the same period, allowing observation of whether they share the same change trends or patterns.

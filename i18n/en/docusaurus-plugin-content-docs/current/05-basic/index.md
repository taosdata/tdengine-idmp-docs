The design philosophy of IDMP is to minimize the need for users to read the user manual. By providing an intuitive user experience and built-in contextual help, the platform aims to lower the barrier to entry. As a result, this user manual focuses primarily on explaining core concepts and features that are less intuitive or harder to understand.

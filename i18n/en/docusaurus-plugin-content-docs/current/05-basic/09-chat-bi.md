title: Chat BI
---

TDengine IDMP allows you to ask the AI questions in natural language. The better and more precise your question, the more likely the AI will return a satisfactory answer.

The AI interprets your question and translates it into one or more tasks for execution. If the question involves your data, the AI generates an appropriate SQL query, and TDengine IDMP executes it to retrieve the data. Then, the AI generates an answer based on the query results. If the question is about using TDengine or other product-related topics, the AI chat functions like a standard AI Q&A system.

IDMP provides Chat BI functionality in three places:

1. AI Chat: Available from the main menu. You can ask questions related to your data or to TDengine.

2. Dashboard Panel: On the panel page for any element or in **Dashboards** > **Panels**, you can use text or voice input to request the AI to generate a panel.

3. Analytics: On the analysis page for any element, you can use text or voice input to request the AI to generate an analysis.

Each time you ask a question, TDengine IDMP interacts with the AI once. Compute consumption depends on the number of queries made.

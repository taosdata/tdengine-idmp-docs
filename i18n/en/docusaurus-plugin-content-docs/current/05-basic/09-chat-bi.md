Like many Chat BI tools, IDMP also provides Smart Data Query capabilities, allowing you to directly ask AI questions in natural language. The better and more precise your question, the more likely AI will return a satisfactory answer.

The AI interprets your question and translates it into one or more tasks for execution. If the question involves your stored data, the AI will generate the appropriate SQL query, and IDMP will execute it to retrieve the data. Then, the AI will generate an answer based on the query results. If the task is about using TDengine or general product-related questions, it functions just like a standard AI Q&A system.

IDMP provides Smart Data Query functionality through three entry points:

1. AI Chat: Available from the main menu. This functions like any other AI tool—you can ask any question related to your data or TDengine. Note: AI-generated SQL is not guaranteed to be 100% accurate. If an error occurs, please take a screenshot and report it to the TDengine team.
1. Dashboard Panel: On any element’s panel list page, or by navigating to “Dashboards” from the main menu and selecting a panel, you can ask questions using text or voice input to request AI to generate a specific type of panel.
1. Analytics: On any element’s analysis list page, you can use text or voice input to ask AI to create the type of real-time analysis you need.
   

Each time you ask a question, IDMP interacts with the AI once. Therefore, compute consumption depends entirely on the number of queries made.

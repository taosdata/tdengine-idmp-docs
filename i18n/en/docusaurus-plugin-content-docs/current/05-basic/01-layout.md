## Main Interface Areas

The IDMP user interface is entirely web-based. After logging in, a typical UI layout consists of the following sections:

1. Main Menu: Includes AI Q&A, Element Browser, Dashboards, Events, and Knowledge Base.
1. Tree Structure: Located on the far left, this is the navigation area where nodes can be expanded or collapsed.
1. Breadcrumb Bar: Displays the current location in the system. If the final node (e.g., an element) has multiple available actions, a dropdown menu will appear.
1. Action Bar: Just below the breadcrumb bar, this row of icons allows users to perform various actions such as delete, save, configure, etc.
1. Main Workspace: Located beneath the action bar, this is the primary area for viewing and editing content such as element lists, attribute lists, panels, and events.
1. Info Bar: At the bottom of the page, it shows information such as the IDMP version and the version of the configuration data.
1. Avatar: At the top right, clicking the avatar allows users to configure personal settings or access the system management page.

Since the UI design may change over time, the best way to understand the layout is to click the avatar icon in the top-right corner and select "Guide Page". It will walk you through the entire UI layout step by step.

## Typical UI Operations

The IDMP UI supports several common interaction patterns:

1. In the left-side tree structure or list views, when you hover over a row, a three-dot icon often appears on the right. Click it to open a contextual menu.
1. In the workspace, if a list is displayed, the "+" button on the right side of the action bar allows you to add new itemsâ€”such as new elements, attributes, or panels.
1. In list views, the "Configure" button at the far right of the action bar lets you customize which columns are displayed.
1. In list views, you may also see a "Paste" button on the right side of the action bar, which lets you paste previously copied items into the current list.
1. On the left side of the action bar in list views, there are often category filters, template filters, and more.
1. In the left-side tree structure, whether you're viewing elements, events, or panels, there are options for favorites and filter lists.
1. Filter lists help you focus on specific content. After clicking the search icon and viewing the results, you can save the filter as a custom view.
1. Click the language icon at any time to switch the display language, or click the theme icon to change the color scheme.

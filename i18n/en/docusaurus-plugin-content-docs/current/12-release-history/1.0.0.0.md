## Features

1. Data Modeling: IDMP manages data through a classic tree-like hierarchical structure. Each node in the tree corresponds to a sensor, device, production line, factory, or logical entity. IDMP refers to nodes as elements, and each node has its own attributes, real-time analytics, visualization panels, events, etc.
1. Data Contextualization: IDMP allows the configuration of descriptive information, categories, locations, physical units, limit values, etc., for each node and its attributes, analytics, panels, notifications, etc., enriching data with rich context and business semantics to provide data contextualization.
1. Data Standardization: Through templates for elements, attributes, analytics, panels, events, etc., along with mappings of attributes to database data, calculation expressions, automatic unit conversions, and more, IDMP provides data standardization capabilities, unifying multi-source heterogeneous data.
1. Data Visualization: IDMP includes a built-in Grafana-style data visualization module, offering panels and dashboards to display data. Visualization types include trend charts, bar charts, pie charts, gauges, statistical values, rich text, tables, etc., with future support for scatter plots, maps, configurations, heatmaps, and more.
1. Real-Time Analytics: Leveraging TDengineâ€™s stream processing capabilities, IDMP provides real-time analytics. Trigger types include sliding windows, timed windows, event windows, state windows, and count windows. Computations can range from simple expressions to data aggregations based on time windows or across devices.
1. Event Management: Real-time analytics can trigger events. Based on the severity of events and configurations, IDMP will notify relevant personnel in real time. Generated events can be acknowledged or escalated. Users can easily review trend changes of related attributes at the time of an event to analyze its cause.
1. Unasked Intelligence: IDMP utilizes AI large models to intelligently perceive business scenarios based on collected data and autonomously recommend panels, real-time analytics, etc., required for business operations in those scenarios. Users can gain business insights without actively asking questions or needing extensive business knowledge and IT skills.
1. Intelligent Data Query: If users have strong business knowledge, they can proactively request IDMP to automatically create visualization panels or real-time analytics needed for business operations, or ask any questions related to system data. Since it requires no IT skills, business users can obtain business insights at any time.
1. Enterprise-Grade Services: IDMP provides role-based access control, version control for data modeling (to be released in the next version), single sign-on, data import/export, backup, and other essential enterprise operational features.

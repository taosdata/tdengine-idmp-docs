## 1. Introduction

TDengine IDMP (Industrial Data Management Platform) is an AI-native IoT and industrial data management platform. It organizes sensor and device data using a classic tree hierarchy, builds a data catalog, provides contextual and standardized data processing, and offers real-time analytics, visualization, event management, and alerting.

This documentation site is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and provides user guides, development documentation, and related resources for TDengine IDMP.

## 2. Installation

### 2.1 Install Prerequisite Tools

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18.0 or above (you can check with `node -v`). You can use nvm to manage multiple Node versions on a single machine. Then, install pnpm globally via npm:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install node
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm --version
```

### 2.2 Install Project Dependencies

Navigate to the project repository directory and run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install  
```

## 3. Local Development and Production Deployment

After editing the documentation, you can start the local development server to preview the website.

### 3.1 Start Preview

The following commands will automatically open a browser window for real-time preview and debugging, suitable for development.

- Start Chinese preview

```bash
pnpm start  --host 0.0.0.0
```

- Start English preview

```bash
pnpm start --host 0.0.0.0 --locale en
```

### 3.2 Production Build

Use the following command to build static files for production into the `build` directory. The generated content can be deployed using any static content hosting service. We use [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/static/) to deploy the IDMP documentation service.

- Build documentation

```bash
pnpm build
```

- Local preview

```bash
pnpm serve 
```

### 3.3 Production Deployment

After code is merged into the main branch, GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the build and deployment process, deploying the generated static files to Azure Static Web Apps.
